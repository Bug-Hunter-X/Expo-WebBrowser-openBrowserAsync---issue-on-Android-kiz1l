# Expo WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync() Issue on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync()` in Expo on Android devices. Under certain configurations, the function fails to open the browser properly or returns incomplete results.

## Bug Description

The `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync()` function, when called on an Android device, sometimes hangs indefinitely or returns a result object that lacks essential properties. This behavior is inconsistent and doesn't always occur. This is particularly problematic because it prevents the application from reliably handling the redirection to an external URL and any expected callbacks.

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  Run the provided `bug.js` code on an Android device or emulator.
2.  Observe the inconsistent behavior of the `openBrowserAsync()` function. In some cases it may work correctly, but in others it will fail to properly open the URL or return the expected result.

## Potential Causes

The issue might be linked to several factors such as the device model, Android version, Expo SDK version, or underlying system configurations. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact root cause.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a potential solution that involves checking for the existence of the necessary result properties before using them.  This helps to mitigate the issues caused by the incomplete results.  This is a workaround and doesn't solve the underlying problem but provides a more robust way to handle the inconsistent behavior.

## Further Investigation

This issue requires additional testing and debugging to precisely identify the underlying causes and a more complete solution.  This may involve inspecting network logs, analyzing device logs, and testing across various Android versions and devices.
